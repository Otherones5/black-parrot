# Project Concept
We chose to alter the size of both i-cache and d-cache simultaneously, for
simplicity.

# Team Members
Alexey C Beall, Thushara Maria Xavier

# Schematic
We did not create any schematic for our change, since it does not involve any
logic design, and it feels like a waste of time to try drawing the schematic for
the i-cache and d-cache simply because the sizes of several ports change.

# Phase III and Phase IV Results
We did not follow the "phase" directions until submission time, though we did
do everything in the order of the phases.  For the sake of not repeating
ourselves, we point you to our notebook, which contains all these results.  They
are not called "Phase III" or "Phase IV", but "16KB synth PPA" or "64KB synth
PPA" and "16KB chip finish PPA" or "64KB chip finish PPA", respectively.
